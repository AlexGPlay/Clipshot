<h1>Clipshot</h1>

Clipshot is a Java application made to solve a problem that many partially solve but that none of them fully solves.<br>
Many times you want to screenshot something in order to paste it into a document, but you have to capture the full screen, capture it and save it or capture it and deal with a new window asking you what do you want to do with that screenshot.<br>
In order to solve this problem I made Clipshot.<br>
Clipshot is a simple application that allows you to capture a part of the screen and paste it wherever you want.
